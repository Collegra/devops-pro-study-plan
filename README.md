## Overview

The goal of this study group is to prepare for and pass the AWS DevOps Professional Certification. The "DOP" is a very challenging certification that also re-certifies one for the Developer and Sysops Associate certifications.

As a group we will work primarily asynchronously via the timeline outlined below.

We will schedule a number of synchronous meetings closer to the exam in order to go through practice tests.

Our current goal is to sit the exam on <code>January 29th, 2022</code>
